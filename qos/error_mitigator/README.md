# Error Mitigator Module

The `error_mitigator` module is a core component of the QOS framework, providing tools for analyzing, transforming, and optimizing quantum circuits to mitigate errors. It includes *Analysis* passes for circuit properties and IR/Graph construction, and *Transformation* passes such as circuit cutting, qubit freezing, and qubit reuse.

## Module Structure

### 1. **`types.py`**
- **Description**: Defines the base classes and interfaces for analysis and transformation passes.
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides the abstract classes for implementing custom analysis and transformation passes.

### 2. **`analyser.py`**
- **Description**: Contains analysis passes for extracting properties and features from quantum circuits.
- **Key Passes**:
  - **`BasicAnalysisPass`**:
    - Constructs basic circuit properties, such as gate counts and measurement operations.
  - **`SupermarqFeaturesAnalysisPass`**:
    - Computes the Supermarq features of the circuit, which are used for benchmarking quantum workloads.
  - **`DependencyGraphFromDAGPass`**:
    - Constructs the dependency graph of the circuit, representing the dependencies between operations.
  - **`QubitConnectivityGraphFromDAGPass`**:
    - Constructs the qubit connectivity graph of the circuit, representing the physical connections between qubits.
  - **`IsQAOACircuitPass`**:
    - Checks if the input circuit is a QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuit.
  - **`QAOAAnalysisPass`**:
    - Constructs QAOA-specific properties for the circuit, such as parameterized gates and mixer layers.

### 3. **`optimizer.py`**
- **Description**: Implements advanced optimization passes to improve circuit execution on quantum hardware.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Circuit Cutting**:
    - Splits large circuits into smaller fragments for distributed execution.
  - **Qubit Freezing**:
    - Identifies and freezes qubits that remain in a fixed state throughout the circuit, reducing noise and improving fidelity.
  - **Qubit Reuse**:
    - Dynamically reuses qubits to minimize the number of physical qubits required for execution.
